Hi I just wanted to talk about some of the 
books I've been reading recently. Um. Currently,  

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:13.480
I'm reading Onyx Storm, this is the third book in 
the series, its fantasy. It came out on Tuesday,  

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:22.240
I am only 27 pages in, I haven't had very 
much time to read. Um. This book is my book  

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:30.200
club read and I am just about halfway. It's 
called My Lady Jane and there is a series  

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.320
on Amazon Prime Video. Um. And then I 
wanted to mention some books that are,  

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:44.320
that have been some of my favorites. This one is 
The Housemaid, uh I read this in probably like 6  

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.760
hours, it was so good and it is becoming a movie. 
Um. This one, The House Across the Lake, this  

00:00:51.760 --> 00:01:00.160
is also one of my favorites. Um, I read it last 
year and it's really really good. Both of these  

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.680
are thrillers and I really liked them both. And 
then my last one is Beach Read. This is one of  

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.880
my favorites, I read it a couple years ago and 
I've reread multiple times. Um and this one is  

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.840
romance. Um, yeah, anyway I hope you got some 
good recommendations and hope you enjoyed it.
