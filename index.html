            Hi I just wanted to talk about some of the books I've been reading
            recently. Um. Currently, I'm reading Onyx Storm, this is the third
            book in the series, its fantasy. It came out on Tuesday, I am only
            27 pages in, I haven't had very much time to read. Um. This book is
            my book club read and I am just about halfway. It's called My Lady
            Jane and there is a series on Amazon Prime Video. Um.
          </p>
          <p>
            And then I wanted to mention some books that are, that have been
            some of my favorites. This one is The Housemaid, uh I read this in
            probably like 6 hours, it was so good and it is becoming a movie.
            Um. This one, The House Across the Lake, this is also one of my
            favorites. Um, I read it last year and it's really really good. Both
            of these are thrillers and I really liked them both. And then my
            last one is Beach Read. This is one of my favorites, I read it a
            couple years ago and I've reread multiple times. Um and this one is
            romance. Um, yeah, anyway I hope you got some good recommendations
            and hope you enjoyed it.
